The flow of your code in a Java Spring Boot application should follow a structured architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability and scalability. A common architectural pattern for web applications is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Here's a high-level overview of how the code flow should be organized in your Turf Booking System:

Model Layer:
This layer represents the data and the business logic of your application. It typically includes:

Entities: Classes that represent your data model. These are typically annotated with @Entity and map to database tables.

Repositories: Interfaces that define methods for interacting with the database using Spring Data JPA. These interfaces provide common CRUD operations and can include custom queries.

Services: Classes that contain the business logic of your application. They coordinate data retrieval, processing, and manipulation. Services often use repositories to interact with the database.

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Objects that carry data between the layers of your application. They help prevent over-fetching or under-fetching of data and improve performance.

Controller Layer:
This layer is responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and returning appropriate responses. It typically includes:

Controllers: Classes that handle HTTP requests and interact with services to retrieve or modify data. Controllers use mappings and annotations like @RestController to define the API endpoints.
View Layer (Optional):
In a Spring Boot backend, the view layer is often separated, and the frontend (e.g., React JS) handles it. However, you might still have a view layer for non-RESTful templates or views.

Integration with Frontend:
If you're using React JS for the frontend, you'll need to build APIs (endpoints) in your Spring Boot backend that the frontend can communicate with. Your frontend will make HTTP requests to these endpoints to fetch or submit data.

Security Layer (Optional):
If your Turf Booking System requires authentication and authorization, you'll need a security layer. This might involve Spring Security to handle user authentication and access control.

Testing:
At each layer, implement unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests to ensure that your application behaves as expected.

Configuration:
Your Spring Boot application can have configuration files (e.g., application.properties or application.yml) for settings, database connections, and more.

The flow of data typically starts from the frontend (user interaction) making requests to your API endpoints. The requests are then handled by controllers, which call services to perform business logic. Services interact with repositories to retrieve or manipulate data from the database. Data is then returned through the layers and presented to the frontend as a response
